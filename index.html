    <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p> This page will serve as a portfolio of everything of significance that I have done throughout my career as an Engineer. I have many different areas where I Have grown and expanded my knowledge and I wanted to have them all in one place for both myself and whoever might want to view them. Please feel free to browse and feel free to contact me with any inqueries. All links lead to a PDF of a project that I worked on over the years and that I feel demonstrates my abilities in someway. I hope you have as much fun looking at my projects as I had doing them. </p>

      <p> <h2> Samples of My Work</h2> </p>


      <p><h4> Overview </h4></p>
        <p> This short presentation I gave to the professor for whom me and one other undergraduate were doing research. The project that I was working on in this lab, called the <a href="http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~mniedre/Site_2/Home.html">Biomedical Optics Research Group</a>, was to construct a powerbox for four devices known as a PMT's. The PMTs observed photons being emmitted from an object that was being hit with a laser. The PHd student who was in charge of the experiment wanted a better and more compact way to control the voltages going to each of the PMTs. These were our plans that we eventually implemented into a testing model.</p>

      <p><h4> Overview </h4></p>
        <p> This presentation was the one that I gave at the end of my first COOP at <a href='http://colorkinetics.com/'> Philips Color Kinetics</a>. It contains all of the work that I was able to accomplish there and pictures to prove it. I was able to do many types of work including board construction and prototype testing. I was even able to test my hand at some basic design of a connector board in Altium.

      <p><h4> Overview </h4></p>
      <p> This report is one that me and a group constructed for our intro engineering class freshaman year. This report that beside technical skill I am also able to present my work in a professional and clean format.

      <p><h4> Overview </h4></p>
      <p> This is the culmination of a semester long lab from my Embedded Design course in which we used Simulink, Linus, and a FPGA to control a robotic arm. This report shows our system that we used to control the robotic arm.</p>
